How to use advice. It's a really difficult thing to put into practice, and many people will become frustrated if an example isn't clearly stated. If one example is given, many will try to emulate that example directly without trying to fit it into their unique situation. An example is when the book The Game was released, and the "Neg" was popularized; a ton of guys went took it as literal advice to insult women in order to make them interested. Whether the topic of the book is good or not can be argued, but it wasn't trying to tell people to be assholes.

Etc can be said for all sorts of advice, no matter if it comes from a book, a blog post, or from your best friend.
