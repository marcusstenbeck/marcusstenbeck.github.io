`Dude, sucking at something is the first step to becoming sorta good at something.`

One of the best feelings I've had was when I got good grades in math. I've always had a strained relationship with the subject, and at times I've cursed it to hell. Yet, I'll be hard-pressed to give a better example of sheer, unadultered, and joyous pride than when I've received good grades on my math tests. It's like being served a cup of hot chocolate while wrapped in a warm blanket after battling a fierce blizzard.

Sustained period of uncomfortable work - you have to feel like you suck a little
You think you may be capable of surviving, but you're not entirely sure
There's a measure of success or failure that you can't control - tests, gatekeepers, etc...
