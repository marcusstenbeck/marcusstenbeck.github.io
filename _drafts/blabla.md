One of the worst things is making something worse when you know that you've made something better in the past. If you've got the resilience to power through your own self-doubt you're putting yourself in the small percentile that are allowing themselves to become really good.

Being good at stuff that you can't be proud of. Oh fuck, there's nothing as hacky as doing something less remarkable because you know you'll get away with it. Other people might praise you over and over again, but you know yourself that that thing you just did isn't your best effort. Everyone needs to use their "safe bets" every now and then, but if you never feel like you stretched yourself you'll stop respecting the people who can't recognize that what you just did was a simple trick.

Sustained period of uncomfortable work - you have to feel like you suck a little
You think you may be capable of surviving, but you're not entirely sure
There's a measure of success or failure that you can't control - tests, gatekeepers, etc...
