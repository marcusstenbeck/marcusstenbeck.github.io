# Reading History

On this page I keep track of stories, articles, books, and *(maybe?)* scriptures that I've read. I can point friends here, and re-discover things I've forgotten. This page has truly endless potential, I guess.

*This page is continually updated and amended.*


## 2014

### September 2014

_Currently reading_ [Thinking, Fast and Slow](http://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Fast-Kahneman-Daniel-Paperback/dp/B00IIAZXVK/), by Daniel Kahneman

_Currently reading_ [Antifragile: Things That Gain from Disorder](http://www.amazon.com/Antifragile-Things-That-Disorder-Incerto/dp/0812979680), by Nassim Taleb

_Currently reading_ [The People's Platform: Taking Back Power and Culture in the Digital Age](http://www.amazon.com/Peoples-Platform-Taking-Culture-Digital-ebook/dp/B00BOCXGSQ/), by Astra Taylor

[The First 20 Hours: How to Learn Anything ... Fast!](http://www.amazon.com/First-20-Hours-Learn-Anything/dp/1591845556/), by Josh Kaufman. I skipped some of the case study chapters, as suggested by the book. Since they're all illustrating how Josh implements the 'temporary obsession' technique it became somewhat repetitive and a bit predictable. I may return to the book to read he skipped chapters later, but I felt that jumping to the concluding chapter after reading 4 case studies gave me the jist of the book.
