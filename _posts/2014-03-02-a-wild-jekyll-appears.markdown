Years ago, choosing a blogging platform was easy – point the browser to [Blogger][blogger] and then go to town (Google is seemingly trying to cram it into their all-you-can-eat-buffét now). That was it. Nowadays – completely different. Selection has gone through the roof. Especially if you're a developer/geek. It's not uncommon to be distracted by the weekly new contender. Oh, geez.

In an attempt to simplify most things in my life I'm switching blogging platform. Not that there was a lot of writing going on. I'll change that. Promise. A man can dream, am I right?

Simplification does however not mean giving up control. After all, I am a developer, and there's this soothing feeling when things are simple enough to keep in my head. Anyway, the "platform" of choice is now [Jekyll][jekyll] instead of [Assemble][assemble]. I'm hosting for free on [Github Pages][gh-pages], and the splendid people over there have hooked Jekyll-support straight up in there. Nice.

Nevertheless, I'll probably regret this "announcement" when I in four months realize I have yet to write a second post. Here's to cognitive dissonance!

Until then you'll find me on [my GitHub][my-gh].
