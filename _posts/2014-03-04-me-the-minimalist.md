We all have a pretty good idea where the conventional life-strategy will take us. Take a look around - there's plenty of proof that it works for a lot of people. Only, it's not for me. I've always been fascinated by alternative lifestyles and ways of thinking.

There are people who live on boats year around, families living in co-ops with many other families, hermits out in the woods or on islands close to nowhere. In other words, there's no shortage of people living lifestyles that inspire reflection. Could any of these be worth exploring?

Recently my interest in this topic has increased, not unlikely due to the fact that I've transcended from university into the working world. There's one concept in particular that kindly, but firmly, has declared my mind a conquered zone - minimalism.

Minimalism only became compelling once I encountered it in the context of what's called a "digital nomad". The term refers to a person who leverages modern technology to work and travel full-time - wherever there's a WiFi connection, there's an office. Bring a laptop and a nose for sniffing out free internet and you're set. Being constantly on the road does however demand being comfortable with giving up a few things. Well, really, a *lot* of things. People who enjoy this lifestyle have adjusted to traveling lightly, and the norm is having everything you own fit into one backpack (yes, one backpack).

And guess what - many of them seem to be enjoying not owning a great deal of stuff. 

That's why I've begun exploring how I can apply minimalism in my own life. Even if I'm not on the road, could a minimalist lifestyle improve things?

I think so.
